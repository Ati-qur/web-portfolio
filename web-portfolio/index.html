            <h3>In 1996, Microsoft released its first competitive browser, which was complete with its own features and HTML tags. It was also the first browser to support style sheets, which at the time was seen as an obscure authoring technique and is today an important aspect of web design. The HTML markup for tables was originally intended for displaying tabular data. However designers quickly realized the potential of using HTML tables for creating the complex, multi-column layouts that were otherwise not possible.</h3>

            <h3>In the 1990s, designing was done such that deigning and aesthetics were given hierarchy over accessibility. Newer features such as CSS were introduced to enhance both the accessibility and the professional outlook for the websites. Flash also came through during the same time period to enhance the development of animations and grant greater options to the general public in this regard.

                Mobile computing however is by far the biggest change that has occurred in web development. They are now able to send and receive data from all over the world.</h3>
